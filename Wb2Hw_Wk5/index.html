                    <h3>Carne Asada Tacos: The Classic</h3>
                    <p>Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Let’s do a beef and a chicken, and one with both. It’s taco Tuesday Monday. How do you feel about hard shelled tacos? I’ve been following that taco truck around all day. Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! Josh’s taco shack is the best taco shack. Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell.</p>
